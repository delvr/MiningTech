Forbids mining until the relevant research project is completed. This makes for a more challenging early game, especially on Tribal starts.

The research project is Machining by default but you can change it to any other project in the Mod Settings.

Requires [HugsLib](https://github.com/UnlimitedHugs/RimworldHugsLib).

Available on [Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1228375660).
